## Bio

I was born on 21 February 1996 in Rio Claro,  Sao Paulo - Brazil.  I received a MSc degree in Computer Science from the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP) in 2020 and a BSc degree from the same University in 2017. My main areas of research interest are Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Image Processing.


## Projects


### Deep Learning Based Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Reconstrction
In this project, I developed a new tool to generate Digital Breast Tomosynthesis images from a set of projections. This software was the result of my master thesis.

### Data Analysis in Motocycles Ads
In this project, I implement a Web Scrapper and a Linear Regression Model to analyse the motocycle classified ads in the OLX.com.br site (platform widely used in Brazil) to find good deals. The construction of this tool is [detailed here](https://medium.com/ensinando-m%C3%A1quinas/coleta-e-an%C3%A1lise-de-dados-de-motos-no-olx-6d0fd914853b).

### IA based Snake Game 
In my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TyzzyNNN), I make artificial intelligence based projects (using techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Deep Learning, etc.) designed to present practical concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning to the Brazilian computing community





### MSc in Computer Science
Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)
During my master, I researched about Deep Learning applied in Breast Tomosynthesis Images reconstruction. I proposed a new [method](https://github.com/daviduarte/DeepLearningDBT) for reconstructing a 3D image from inner breast, given a set of 2Dimages (projections).

### BSc in Computer Science
Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)
In my final paper, I researched objective measures clustering approaches to filters interesting association rules.


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/daviduarte/daviduarte.github.me/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
