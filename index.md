# Projects


## Deep Learning Based Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Reconstrction
In this project, I developed a new tool to generate Digital Breast Tomosynthesis images from a set of projections. This software was the result of my master thesis.

## Data Analysis in Motocycles Ads
In this project, I implement a Web Scrapper and a Linear Regression Model to analyse the motocycle classified ads in the OLX.com.br (platform widely used in Brazil) to find good deals. The construction of this tool is [detailed here](https://medium.com/ensinando-m%C3%A1quinas/coleta-e-an%C3%A1lise-de-dados-de-motos-no-olx-6d0fd914853b).

## IA based Snake Game 
In this project, I implement the Snake Game that plays automatically. I used a Fully Connected Artificial Neural Network (FCANN) as the model and Genetic Algorithm to find the best weights of the FCANN. The result and more details can be found in my [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/0WVAWjVOygE)
