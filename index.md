## Bio

I was born on 21 February 1996 in Rio Claro,  Sao Paulo - Brazil.  I received a MSc degree in Computer Science from the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP) in 2020 and a BSc degree from the same University in 2017. My main areas of research interest are Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Image Processing.


## Education

### MSc in Computer Science
Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)
During my master, I researched about Deep Learning applied in Breast Tomosynthesis Images reconstruction. I proposed a new [method](https://github.com/daviduarte/DeepLearningDBT) for reconstructing a 3D image from inner breast, given a set of 2Dimages (projections).

### BSc in Computer Science
Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)
In my final paper, I researched objective measures clustering approaches to filters interesting association rules.
